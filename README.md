# MiniShell

A POSIX-like shell implemented in C. Supports interactive prompts, command history, pipes, redirections, environment variable expansion, signal handling, and a set of built-in commands.

## Features

- Interactive prompt with command history (readline)
- Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`, `$?`)
- Single and double quote handling
- Redirections: `<`, `>`, `<<` (heredoc), `>>`
- Pipes (`|`) with full pipeline support
- Signal handling: `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`, `Ctrl-\`
- Built-in commands: `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, `history`, `exit`, `help`, `usage`
- Local binaries in `./bin/` are resolved before system `$PATH`

---

## Prerequisites

### GCC and Make

- **Linux / WSL**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential`
- **macOS**: `brew install gcc`

### Readline

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
```bash
sudo apt install libreadline-dev=8.0-4
```

**macOS (Homebrew)**
```bash
brew tap-new $USER/old-readline
brew extract --version=8.2 readline $USER/old-readline
brew install $USER/old-readline/readline@8.2
```

**WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**

WSL runs a Linux distribution, so use the same command as Linux:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreadline-dev=8.0-4
```

---

## Build

Clone the repository and build with `make`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziqiqiiii/minishell.git
cd minishell
make
```

This compiles `libft`, all system programs under `./bin/`, and the `minishell` binary.

Other Makefile targets:

| Command      | Description                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| `make`       | Build everything (`make all`)          |
| `make run`   | Build and launch minishell immediately |
| `make clean` | Remove object files                    |
| `make fclean`| Remove object files and binary         |
| `make re`    | Full rebuild (`fclean` + `all`)        |

---

## Run

```bash
./minishell
```

Or build and run in one step:

```bash
make run
```

## Built-in Commands

| Command              | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `echo [-n] [args...]`| Print arguments to stdout; `-n` omits newline    |
| `cd [path\|'-']`      | Change directory; defaults to `$HOME`; `-` goes to `$OLDPWD` |
| `pwd`                | Print current working directory                  |
| `export [name=value]`| Set or display environment variables             |
| `unset [name]`       | Remove environment variables                     |
| `env`                | Print all environment variables                  |
| `history`            | Print command history                            |
| `exit [n]`           | Exit shell with status `n`                       |
| `help`               | List all built-in commands                       |
| `usage [builtin]`    | Show detailed help for a built-in command        |

---

## Shell Operators

| Operator | Description                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `\|`      | Pipe stdout of left to stdin of right |
| `<`      | Redirect stdin from file             |
| `>`      | Redirect stdout to file (overwrite)  |
| `>>`     | Redirect stdout to file (append)     |
| `<<`     | Heredoc — read stdin until delimiter |

---

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning                          |
|------|----------------------------------|
| `0`  | Success                          |
| `1`  | General error                    |
| `2`  | Misuse of shell built-ins        |
| `126`| Command found but cannot execute |
| `127`| Command not found                |
| `128`| Invalid argument to `exit`       |
| `130`| Terminated by `Ctrl-C`           |
| `137`| Terminated by signal             |
| `255`| Exit status out of range         |

## Architecture

Input flows through these pipeline stages:

```
readline input
     │
     ▼
  Expander          expand $VAR and $? before tokenising
     │
     ▼
   Lexer            tokenise into COMMAND / PIPE / RDIN / RDOUT / RDAPP / HEREDOC
     │
     ▼
   Parser           build a binary syntax tree (BST)
     │
     ▼
  Executor          recurse the BST and dispatch to:
     ├── Pipe handler
     ├── Redirection handler  (< > >> <<)
     └── Built-in / execve
```

One global variable `g_exit_status` tracks the most recent foreground pipeline exit code.

make integration   # run integration shell scripts
make test          # run both
```

Generate unit tests for a module with AI assistance:

```bash
make ai-unit-tests MODULE=<name>
# e.g. make ai-unit-tests MODULE=expand
```
